        <h3>BREAKING OF BREAD</h3>
        <hr/>
        <p>In the upper room, on the night Jesus was betrayed, after breaking bread and taking a cup of wine, He commanded the disciples “this do in remembrance of me.” (Luke 22, 1 Corinthians 11)  So, following the pattern of the disicples and the early church, (Acts 2:42, Acts 20:7) we break bread on the first day of the week as the climax of our morning worship. We do this &quot;till He come&quot;.</p>

        <h3>BELIVER'S BAPTISM</h3>
        <hr/>
        <p>In keeping with the Lord’s command (Matthew 28:18-20) and following the Lord’s example (Matthew 3:13-17) we believe that all born again Christians, upon profession of faith in Christ as their Saviour, should be baptised by immersion. This was the practice of the early church (Acts 2:41, 8:12,) as a public demonstration of a personal transformation.</p>
